- Installation

1. Open dirpass.cgi in your favourite text editor and edit the top line 
to represent the path to Perl 5 on your web server. 

The most common locations are #!/usr/bin/perl or #!/usr/local/bin/perl 
though it may be different on your server.  If you are unsure, contact 
your system administrator/web hosting company.


2. Save dirpass.cgi and upload it via FTP in ASCII mode to your web server.  
Uploading in Binary will not work, you should find this option in your FTP 
program, most likely under 'Transfer Type/Method' in the menu system.


3. Set the permissions of dirpass.cgi to 755 (executable).  To do this you 
can either login to your server via telnet/SSH and type: 'chmod 755 dirpass.cgi'

If you're using a FTP program like CuteFTP or WsFTP you may find a 'CHMOD' or 
'Permissions' option on the menu when 'right-clicking' on the dirpass.cgi file.


4. Open your web browser and call up the dirpass.cgi file as you would for any 
other file on your web site.  


5. You will be prompted to choose a password for your copy of DirectoryPass.  
You can also select the web server operating system you are using, if you 
are running a Linux/Unix web server then this does not need to be adjusted, 
selecting Windows disables the password encryption, this should be used on 
all Windows web servers, if running a Cobalt RAQ server then select the Cobalt 
RAQ option to generate compatible .htaccess files.


6. The jp_lang.pl and tr_lang.pl files are optional and do not need to be
uploaded.  Upload jp_lang.pl if you would like to use the Japanese language
interface, or upload tr_lang.pl if you would like to use the Turkish language
interface.  Upload in ASCII mode, permissions should not need to be changed,
try 755 if problems occur.

- Troubleshooting

If you have any problems, please feel free to visit the support forum at:
http://my.DirectoryPass.com/forum/

If you have trouble creating .htaccess and .htpasswd files, check your path 
is correct and set the permissions on the directory where you want to create 
the file to 755 or 777.

If you have trouble setting your administrator password when installing 
DirectoryPass, try setting the permissions on the directory containing 
dirpass.cgi to 755 or 777.  Alternatively, create a blank text file called
dp_setup.pl in the same directory as dirpass.cgi and set it's permissions 
to 777 or 755.
